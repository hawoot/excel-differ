## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Evaluated Values**: Can only extract cached values from workbook. Cannot recompute formulas (would require full Excel calculation engine).

2. **Tables/Charts/Pivots**: Placeholder implementations. These require deeper XML parsing of Excel internals.

3. **Calculation Chain**: Not yet extracted. Low priority as formulas themselves are captured.

4. **External Links/Connections**: Not yet implemented.

5. **Callback/Webhook Support**: Framework exists (`CALLBACKS_ENABLED`) but not implemented.

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Testing & Stabilization (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for normalizer
- [ ] Create integration tests for each endpoint
- [ ] Test with real Excel files (various sizes, formats)
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent requests
- [ ] Test XLSB conversion with LibreOffice
- [ ] Test git authentication (SSH & HTTPS)

#### Phase 2: Advanced Excel Features (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Implement tables extraction (Table definitions, column types)
- [ ] Implement charts extraction (Basic chart metadata)
- [ ] Implement pivot tables extraction
- [ ] Implement styles extraction (Cell styles, number formats, themes)
- [ ] Implement calculation chain extraction
- [ ] Implement external links extraction

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add authentication to API endpoints (JWT/OAuth)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Implement result cleanup scheduler
- [ ] Add health checks for all components
- [ ] Create deployment documentation for Kubernetes
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

#### Phase 4: Enhancement (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Callback/webhook support for async notifications
- [ ] Web UI for exploring diffs
- [ ] Excel formula parsing & dependency analysis
- [ ] Support for .xls (old Excel format)
- [ ] Streaming large file processing
- [ ] Differential snapshots (only changed sheets)

### Security
- ⚠️ No API authentication (critical for production)
- ✅ Git auth via SSH/HTTPS
- ⚠️ No HTTPS/TLS termination in Docker Compose
- ⚠️ No secrets management

### Monitoring
- ❌ No metrics collection
- ❌ No log aggregation
- ✅ Basic health check endpoint

### Performance
- ⚠️ No load testing performed
- ⚠️ No optimization for large files (100MB+)
- ✅ Async processing with configurable workers

## Conclusion

The **MVP is complete and functional** for the core use cases:
1. ✅ Flatten Excel files to git-friendly snapshots
2. ✅ Commit snapshots to a Git repository
3. ✅ Compare two Excel files with structured diff output

**Ready for**: Integration testing, alpha deployment

**Not ready for**: Production deployment without:
- Authentication
- Comprehensive testing
- Monitoring/alerting
- Security hardening

**Estimated effort to production**:
- Testing & basic hardening: 1-2 weeks
- Full production features: 3-4 weeks
