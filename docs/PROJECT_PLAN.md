# Excel Differ - Project Plan and Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01
**Version:** 3.0
**Status:** Phase 2 - Component Architecture Design

---

## Overview

Excel Differ is a modular system for converting Excel workbooks into version-control-friendly text representations, enabling meaningful diffs of Excel files. The system uses a **plugin-based architecture** with clearly defined component interfaces for maximum flexibility and extensibility.

---

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Flattener Component ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status:** Production-ready (v2.1.0)

**Completed:**
- Core extraction engine (formulas, values, metadata, VBA, charts, tables)
- Dual-order formula extraction (by row and by column)
- Manifest generation with file hashes
- CLI interface
- Comprehensive documentation
- Build scripts and virtual environment setup

**Location:** [components/flattener/](../components/flattener/)

---

### Phase 2: Plugin Architecture Design üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**

**Status:** Interface design complete, implementation pending

**Goal:** Create a loosely coupled, pluggable architecture where components can be swapped, extended, and independently developed.

**Design Decisions:**
1. **Separation of Concerns:** Split "getting files" (Source) from "uploading results" (Destination)
2. **Interface-Based:** All components implement abstract interfaces
3. **No Optional Components:** All components required, use NoOp implementations to disable
4. **Configuration-Driven:** YAML config determines which implementations to use
5. **Multiple Implementations:** Support API-based (Bitbucket) and local (filesystem, GitPython) implementations

**Components Defined:**

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Source** | Get files to process (Bitbucket, local, GitHub, S3) | Interface designed |
| **Destination** | Upload processed results (Bitbucket, local, GitHub, S3) | Interface designed |
| **Converter** | Convert Excel formats (.xlsb ‚Üí .xlsm) | Interface designed |
| **Flattener** | Flatten Excel to text | ‚úÖ Implemented, needs wrapper |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinate workflow | Interface designed |

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- Strategy Pattern for pluggable implementations
- Dependency Injection (all components passed to orchestrator)
- Factory Pattern for creating component instances from config

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Separate Source and Destination Components
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Rationale:** "Getting files" and "uploading results" are fundamentally different concerns with different implementations (Git, local, S3, HTTP). Separating them provides maximum flexibility.

### Decision 2: All Components Required (No Optionals)
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Rationale:** Explicit is better than implicit. Use NoOp implementations (e.g., `NoOpConverter()`) to disable features rather than `None` or optional parameters.

### Decision 3: Depth-Based Initial Sync
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Rationale:** When no sync state exists, `depth` parameter controls how far back to process: 0=do nothing, 1=last commit, 2=last 2 commits, etc. Prevents accidental full-history processing.

### Decision 4: Configuration-Driven Component Selection
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Rationale:** YAML configuration specifies which implementation to use for each component. Enables switching implementations without code changes.

### Decision 5: Include/Exclude Patterns
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Rationale:** Users need fine-grained control over which files to process. Include patterns define what to process, exclude patterns define exceptions.

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ All component interfaces clearly defined and documented
- ‚è≥ Orchestrator can coordinate any combination of components
- ‚è≥ Can process files from Bitbucket and save locally
- ‚è≥ Can process files from local folder and save to Bitbucket
- ‚è≥ Can process files from Bitbucket and save to same repo
- ‚è≥ Depth-based sync works correctly for initial runs
- ‚è≥ Include/exclude patterns work correctly
- ‚è≥ All components have >80% test coverage
- ‚è≥ Documentation complete and clear

### Overall Success Criteria:
- Excel files can be tracked in version control with meaningful diffs
- System works reliably in automated workflows (CI/CD)
- Components can be independently developed and tested
- New source/destination types can be added easily
- Configuration is clear and maintainable
- Errors are handled gracefully with clear messages
- Performance is acceptable (<5 minutes for typical workbook)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Bitbucket API Rate Limiting
**Mitigation:** Implement caching, batch operations, use local git clone as fallback

### Risk 2: Large File Uploads via API
**Mitigation:** Implement chunked uploads, add timeout handling, document size limits

### Risk 3: Complex Configuration
**Mitigation:** Provide example configs for common scenarios, validation with helpful errors

### Risk 4: Platform Differences (Windows vs Linux)
**Mitigation:** Abstract platform-specific code behind interfaces, test on both platforms

---

## Open Questions

### To Be Decided:
1. Should we support GitPython as alternative to API-based implementations?
   - **Answer Pending:** Yes, but lower priority than Bitbucket API

2. How to handle authentication for multiple repos?
   - **Current:** Separate tokens in config for source and destination

3. Should orchestrator support parallel file processing?
   - **Current:** No, process sequentially for now

4. How to handle large repositories with many Excel files?
   - **To Explore:** Incremental processing, filtering by path
